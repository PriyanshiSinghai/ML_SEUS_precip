# ML_SEUS_precip
A project predicting SEUS precipitation using different deep-learning methods

## Abstract

This project explores the predictability of daily southeastern U.S. (SEUS) precipitation anomalies using machine learning models. We compare index-based and grid-based predictors using logistic regression (LR), fully connected neural networks (FCNN), and convolutional neural networks (CNN). Results indicate that index-based models fail to provide reliable forecasts, while CNNs utilizing gridded climate data offer the most accurate and dependable predictions.

## Introduction

Accurate precipitation prediction is crucial for weather forecasting and climate risk assessment. This study evaluates different machine learning approaches to improve SEUS precipitation forecasting by leveraging large-scale climate data.

## Objective

The goal is to assess the effectiveness of ML models in predicting SEUS precipitation anomalies, comparing index-based predictors with grid-based climate fields.

## Methodology

Index-Based Models: LR and FCNN trained on climate indices.

Grid-Based Models: LR and CNN trained on large-scale circulation data.

Evaluation Metrics: Prediction accuracy and reliability.

## Key Findings

Index-based models fail to provide accurate forecasts.

Grid-based CNN models outperform others in both accuracy and reliability.

## Impact

This project has significant implications for industries reliant on accurate weather forecasting, such as agriculture, disaster management, and energy production. Improved precipitation prediction can enhance water resource planning, reduce financial losses from extreme weather events, and optimize renewable energy generation by providing better forecasts for hydroelectric and solar power management.

## Conclusion

CNNs utilizing gridded climate fields demonstrate superior predictive capabilities for SEUS precipitation forecasting. Future work will focus on refining model architectures and incorporating additional climate variables.
